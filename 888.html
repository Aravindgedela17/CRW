            <p class="par">➼Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons.This practice reduces the reliance of crops on one set of nutrients, pest and weed pressure, along with the probability of developing resistant pests and weeds.</p>

            <p class="par">➼The best crop-rotation method considers plant families
                          The most common method of crop rotation proposes that leafy crops, root crops, fruiting crops, and legumes be planted together. This approach is based on the theory that these groups each have the same soil needs.</p>

            <p class="par">➼Knowing what family a plant belongs to can be useful in making decisions about rotating plants for managing pests and soil fertility in the garden. Plants in a family are genetically related, so they have similar characteristics. As an example, members of the Cucurbitaceae, among other shared characteristics, have deeply lobed or divided leaves, separate male and female flowers on each plant (termed "monoecious" plants) with five fused petals, similar fruit types and tendrils for climbing.</p>
